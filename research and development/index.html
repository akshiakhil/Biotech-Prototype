                <h2>Multiplex Lateral Flow Assays for Respiratory Viruses</h2>
                <p>One of our key areas of innovation is the development of multiplex lateral flow assays designed to detect multiple respiratory viruses in a single test. Our team is at the forefront of validating a comprehensive diagnostic kit that can accurately detect:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19)</li>
                    <li>Influenza A and B</li>
                    <li>Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV)</li>
                </ul>
                <p>These assays offer rapid, point-of-care diagnostics, enabling healthcare providers to swiftly identify and differentiate between viral infections. This is especially critical for managing outbreaks, streamlining treatment decisions, and preventing the spread of highly contagious respiratory diseases.</p>

                <h2>Biosimilars for Infectious Diseases and Cancers</h2>
                <p>Retroindica is also committed to the development of biosimilarsâ€”highly similar, cost-effective alternatives to existing biological therapies. We leverage recombinant DNA technologies to create biosimilars that target both infectious diseases and cancers, offering affordable and accessible treatment options.</p>
                <p>Our focus includes:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Monoclonal antibodies that combat viral infections such as SARS-CoV-2 and other emerging pathogens.</li>
                    <li>Targeted cancer therapies designed to inhibit tumor growth and improve patient survival rates.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>By applying the latest advancements in recombinant DNA technology, we ensure that our biosimilars meet the highest standards of safety, efficacy, and affordability, offering patients cutting-edge treatment options without the financial burden often associated with biologics.</p>
